 lore.39.t:0 "Russian Situation"
 lore.39.d:0 "In July of 1914, Russia entered the Great War on the side of the Triple Entente in response to the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on the Kingdom of Serbia. In the turn of the 20th century, Russia was considered a great military power and at the start of the war Russia was making vast territorial gains not only in East Prussia, but also in the regions of Galicia and Carpathia, taking Lemberg (which they renamed Lwow) with relative ease. However after a successful joint counter attack by the Germans and Austrians, Russia was pushed back and the tides turned in the Triple Alliance's favour. The Russian Empire was now in the period of the war referred to as the Great Retreat. By 1916, Russia was completely pushed out of Poland and Lithuania. Something drastic had to be done.\nIn June of 1916, Russia, under General Brusilov, made a huge offensive that collapsed Austria's army and caused the inevitable breakdown of the fragile multi-ethnic empire. Germany was now facing a two front war with no remaining allies, and sued for peace in late 1916.\nAfter the war, Russia faced a long and difficult recovery. However, thanks to Russian men, resources, and the vastness of the Russian agricultural empire, it rebuilt itself quickly and even enjoyed an economic boom by continuing to adopt some of the proposed reforms by former Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin in the early 1930s.\nIn 1936, Russia possesses the largest army in the world, numbering over one million men in the field and has the world's fourth largest navy, after the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Empire of Japan. It is truly both a regional and a world power, and is even considered by some political scientists to be the first military and economic superpower in human history."

 lore.40.t:0 "Prussian Situation"
 lore.40.d:0 "The defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1916 meant that the German Empire was now facing a two front war that not even the finest of empires could handle. Exhausted and weakened, the Kaiser sued for peace after the Russian decisive victory at Konigsberg.\nThe Treaty of Brussels completely dismantled the German Empire into several smaller German states. In the North, Prussia would remain under Russian influence. In the South, Bavaria would be under joint Anglo-French influence. However, these spheres of influence were never established, as Germany collapsed into total civil war. The year of 1919 marked the abdication of King Rupprecht von Wittelsbach and the subsequent rise of the Bavarian Socialist Republic (which later reformed into the Southern Commune).\nAt first, it seemed like the Communists might win their fight but thanks to the French (assisted by Prussian Freikorps) who feared the rise of communism in Germany, invaded the of Rhine and defeated the Red Army in the battle of Mainz. The conflict ended in a draw and came to a stalemate. In 1921, the Treaty of Wilhelmshaven was signed between the Northern states of Germany, which marked the creation of the Berlin Pact to protect the newly formed countries of Niederdeutschland and Saxony from a potential communist invasion as well as the creation of a buffer state in Baden-Württemberg. The Confederation of the Rhine did not participate nor sign the Treaty of Wilhelmshaven.\nIn 1936, the Kingdom of Prussia, under an German reunification obsessed Kaiser,  is facing a minor depression which is caused by both their unstable economic situation and the stock market crash in France. However, most importantly, Prussia managed to preserve some of its navy. As for its army, their troops and manpower fielded are small, but the people of Prussia have been ready for battle since the dissolution of their Kaiser's rightful lands."

 lore.44.t:0 "French Situation"
 lore.44.d:0 "The French emerged victorious in the Great War... but at a steep cost. France has lost a whole generation of men in the fields of Flanders and defending the integral city of Verdun. The Treaty of Brussels was supposed to restore order and tranquility in Europe. It didn't\nFrance failed to establish influence in Western Germany and was threatened by the communist uprising in Germany. The French invaded the lower Rhineland, dominantly because of its industrial capacity. It was believed that the Greater Saar region would provide leverage with the Germans, but it has ultimately angered the German majority. As the French retreated from Rhine, Saarland remained under French occupation.\nAlthough Russia left the Entente and formed its own sphere of influence, France still keeps a cordial relationship with the Tsar.\nCurrently in 1936, France is a vast colonial empire under liberal rule. Although our government is divided and fractured, we still maintain the third largest army in the world, with 600,000 men in our armed forces. The next decade will define French history. There is an equal chance for either the restoration of one of our former royal houses, the rise of the extreme left, or the maintenance of the status quo. The future will be decided by the 1936 election in Spring. One thing is for certain, however, and every French man, woman, and child can all agree on one thing. Vive la France!"

 lore.46.t:0 "Communard Situtaion"
 lore.46.d:0 "The Kingdom of Bavaria gained its independence in 1917. A product of the Treaty of Brussels, it’s creation was aimed to reduce the German capability to wage war. In the autumn of 1918, after a general worker’s strike, a communist movement under Karl Liebknecht overthrew the conservative government under the House of Wittelsbach, forcing King Albrecht to abdicate and forced into exile within Prussia. The newly established government quickly gained support by the Bavarian people. Liebknecht believed that he could gain the most influence within South Germany due to Germany’s extreme fragmentation. The Southern Commune was soon proclaimed in order to easily claim the entirety of Southern Germany.\nThe South German Liberation Army was assembled soon after the Southern Commune’s formation, numbering around 100.000 men under the command of their supreme leader, Ernst Thälmann. The Southern Commune invaded Baden shortly after their army’s organisation. After capturing the Badenese capital, Stuttgart, the South German Liberation Army moved toward the Rhine River where they were met by the French Army. The French feared that Thälmann would spread his influence to the Benelux region, the remainder of Germany, and eventually, the world. The SGLA was crushed at the Battle of Mainz and was forced to retreat back to the capital of the Southern Commune, München (anglicised as Munich). Once there, they regrouped and rearmed. The SGLA prepared to defend their homeland from French invaders, but the French Army did not even cross the South German border.\nThe Southern Commune was not and still isn’t recognised by the international community. Currently, the Southern Commune is an industrial powerhouse that rivals and even dwarfs some of the countries in the former German Empire. Its army is small but well equipped and organised. Liebknecht's ultimate goal is to first reunite Germany in the name of communism. After that, he plans on uniting Europe under communism. And after that... the world..."

 lore.48.t:0 "British Situation"
 lore.48.d:0 "At the outbreak of the Great War, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland did not want to intervene in the Great War. However, after the German trespassing and their execution of the Schlieffen Plan, Britain was forced to enter to protect its Belgian ally. At the start of the war, the British Army was considered one of the most professional, advanced, and most battlefield-conditioned army in the entire world. Even though it only numbered around 100,000 men, it managed to halt the German advance into France.\nUntil the end of the Great War, the British Empire fiercely defended France and lost thousands of men in the Battle of Somme and the Battle of Ypres. In 1917, with the collapse of Germany and Austria, the United Kingdom, alongside the rest of the Triple Entente, decided the fate of Central Europe during the Brussels Peace Conference.\nAfter the war, the United Kingdom encountered many economical and political difficulties, both at home and overseas. The biggest difficult was the general labour strike of 1921, which both paralysed Britain's industrial capacity and also caused the people of Ireland to declare independence, which was forcibly accepted by Parliament.\nIn 1936, the British have had minimal losses, retaining their empire and spreading their influence. Britannia still rules the waves, as well as most of the world. God save the King!"
 lore.48.a:0 "Yes, Sir!"
 lore.2.t:0 "American Situation"
 lore.2.d:0 "During 1916, whilst war raged across Europe in the Great War, President Woodrow Wilson, upon receiving the Democratic nomination for President proclaimed that “regardless of any further changes in the European war, the United States shall remain a neutral state”. President Wilson stayed true to his word and the United States never got involved in the Great War. By 1921, the Senator of Ohio, Warren Harding became President after defeating Ohio Governor Cox and Assistant Navy Secretary Franklin Roosevelt. Harding passed on August 15th 1923, 13 days after suffering a heart attack. His legacy lived on through President Coolidge, who implemented the ‘Harding Doctrine’ of undisturbed Isolation. Then on March 4th 1929, Herbert Hoover became President, marking the start of the most turbulent years of American history from between the war of 1812 until the death of Lincoln.\nBy 1930, industrial and agricultural production stagnated before taking a significant downturn in December 1932, just weeks after Hoover’s landslide victory against New York Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt after the public learned of Roosevelt’s crippling disability following polio. Hoover failed to improve the situation and his questionable dealings that linked back to the Teapot Dome Scandal that crippled Harding’s administration, suggested that Hoover personally profited by using the Commerce department to sell some of the oil. Hoover was soon impeached by Congress and on July 4th 1934, Charles Curtis was sworn in as the 32nd President \nThroughout the past 6 years, the Socialist party has gained ground across many industrial states whilst Huey Long and his American Union Party now dominates politics in the former Confederate states, resulting in a divided Congress. With increasing fears over President Curtis’ health, many wonder whether he will run in the upcoming Presidential Election, or potentially become the first President to resign. Regardless, the country teeters on the edge of disaster with a competitive four-way Presidential Election and it is unclear what may happen next."

 lore.4.t:0 "Japanese Situation"
 lore.4.d:0 "With the defeat of the Russian Empire in 1905, the Empire of Japan established itself as a world power. In 1915 Japan joined the Entente in fight against the Central Powers and gained some islands in the Pacific.\nWith the Great War's ending a old enemy returned, the Russian Empire and so did the Asian arms race begin. Both Russia and Japan invested huge amount of resources into their respective militaries, Japan created a mighty fleet while the Russians focused on their ground forces.\nIn 1933 these two Empires took advantage of Chinese civil war to invade Manchuria to set up puppet regimes. With the Chinese future unclear, both sides are eager to take more land and create a greater sphere of influence in Asia.\nIn 1936 Japan shares a large land border and a larger maritime border however it is protected by the great Imperial Japanese Navy. Japan is led by their Empreror Hirohito who is loved and praised by millions however a new democratic movement is on the rise who calls for a liberalised regime and end of the imperialism. As well as that Japan also holds Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, both claimed by Russia which makes Japan's peaceful future uncertain."

 lore.10.t:0 "Austrian Situation"
 lore.10.d:0 "In 1917 Austria-Hungary was singlehandely defeated and dismantled by the Russian Empire. Several of its old lands became subject to Russian Influence and lost its empire. Austria became a conflict of interest between the aristocratic Russians and the democratic Entene. In the end a compromise was reached, Austria became a constitutional republic similiar to Britian with the Habsburgs. With the death of Karl of Habsburg the already little Russians influence vanished with the rise of Otto von Habsburg who was loved by the people and supported democratic princibles. But even with neutrality in the grand schemes the situation in Austria is not stable. The economy has been declining in the last years and is depended on foreign loans. The ruling party, the CS supported by Otto himself, is in a power battle with the Social democrats who are rising in popularity due to the economic crisis. Many nationalist and conservatives fear the rise of the social democrats as the ruling party due to the communist bavarians on the german border. If the CS won't win the power fight with Otto against the SPÖ, nationalists might take drastic measures."
 lore.10.a:0 "Long live Austria! Long live Otto von Habsburg!"
 lore.12.t:0 "Turkish Situation"
 lore.12.d:0 "The story of the Turkish nation began during the downfall of the Ottoman Empire. With the capitulation of Germany came also the capitulation of the Ottoman Empire. The lands of what is now Turkey were scrambled up between the victors of the war with no care about the people there. Turkey became a playground of imperialistic influence between West and East. But when Greece demanded Izmir without ever joining the war, we resisted. Atatürk took control of the nation and fought again the Greek menace. The battle of imperalistic interests continued, Russia supporting our nation while the West supporting Greece. We won the war and were able to form the borders of the modern Turkish state but with the cost of Russian influence. Throughout the last decade we have noticed that even if our republic was able to get rid off Russian influence completely, our nation would always fall victim to imperialist intersts again due to the status of the country and position. The Turkish people are sick of being toys in the grand scheme and are again desiring the times where we once a global power aswell. Maybe the old Empire wasn't that bad?"
