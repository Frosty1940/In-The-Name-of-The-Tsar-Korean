 italy.353.d:0 "The Cape to Cairo, a proposal made to simplify imperial administration has, since it's beginning, seen endless delays. The programme was finally made possible with the end of the great war, seeing the transfer of German territories and thus allowing a contigous, red line down the continent. Unfortunately, actually filling the railway gap has proved an issue. Gauge, rainforest, desert, all throw up huge barriers to the project. Until now, anyways. The Italian government, flush with funding in it's recent economic boom, has offered to foot the bill of a completion of a railway from Cape Town to Cairo, linking the gaps, and standardising the entire line's rolling stock and gauge. Of course, this comes with distasteful, political strings attached. It would allow us to integrate Egypt, however."
