Last night young members of the KPB and the Rexist party were violently fighting each other just two streets away. Two dead and five seriously injured, just the beginning Zeeland knew. They had to stop this.\n\n He had talked with Pierlot, Spaack and other politicians the other night on the phone. They talked about the loyalty of the army, about the support of the king and so much more. The situation was not hopeless. The biggest hope was now the king. Zeeland just needed to convince Spaack to give the King emergency powers to disband the parliament. He knew Spaack would not like that but he had a good feeling that he could convince him.\n\n Zeeland took a glass of whiskey. He usually did not drink especially not in the morning but he was so tired and sometimes felt like he could collapse. He looked at the clock and stood up. "Almost 8am, I have to go. Ready my car." Paul put on his jacket and hurried to the door. He felt sick but he knew it would work out. It always works out. He opened the door and looked for the car. He saw it just 10 feet down the road to his left and was about to go until he heard a loud sound behind him- A car was driving too fast down the road and someone was leaning out of the cars rear window.

"Bring me Degrelle on the phone"\n\n The trucks were driving trough the rain at a fast pace. Lucas was inspecting his weapon. They were not told why they were ordered to Namur but almost everyone had the same suspicion. He did not really know what to think of it. He disliked socialists and communist as a strong Catholic but he was still a believer in democracy and freedom. Was this wrong? But what should he do? He was just a simple solider and soldiers follow orders. The truck stopped and he and his comrades were ordered to get out. He took a deep breath. He was not dumb, he knew what was gonna happen soon.\n\n They stormed the building. People were thrown on the ground. Screams. Papers were being torn apart. Chaos. Someone fired.

"Now comes the biggest challenge" Degrelle mumbled to himself. The Coalition with the VNV is on shacky grounds at best. Both parties where occupied with cleansing out each other enemies in Flanders and Wallonia, but this is now over. Now both parties need to work together and this will not work. Their authoritarian ideas are the only things which made this coalition possible but them and his parties their nationalistic ideas are stronger. The VNV wants one thing and that is independence and the incoporation into the Netherlands. But he has found an oppurtunity. During the purge chaos in Flanders a extremist party called Verdinaso was mostly active in the purge and it seems like they support the same Beglian unity ideas like them. The only way to avoid a civil war is to make the Verdinaso take over the VNV.\n\n At the same time Staf De Clercq in Flanders was setting up plans for expelling the federalists out of his party, making contacts with the Netherland and gathering weapons for the upcoming war of independence."

Our spies inside the VNV have documented plans of the VNV involving an uprising and have delivered evidence of them gathering weapons. Degrelle and Severen were given the perfect oppurtunity.\n\n This morning the forces of Verdinaso stormed the headquaters of the VNV and arrested all prominent members of the VNV and confiscated all the weapons they were able to find. With this incident the VNV has lost the faith to rule responsible in the government and has also become a danger to the state. King Leopold has therefore banned the VNV and now Verdinaso will reign in Flanders and work together as a political party with the Rexists. \n\n Degrelle and the Rexists had finally done it.

Furthermore it seems like the majority of the Flemish Soldiers are on their side.

The King tries to negotiate with Staf De Clercq promising more autonomy to Flanders but that does not satisfy their demands, it is already to late.
