 BEL_memory_albert:0 "호나우르 알버르트의 유산"
 BEL_memory_albert_desc:0 "Rarely throughout history are a people blessed by a ruler such as Albert the First. The soldier king, who devoted all he was and had to the nation in war and then all his remaining life to it's rebuilding, is responsible alone for the monarchists at all.

 BEL_Vlaanderen_mines_desc:0 "Though the low countries have traditionally been limited in their mining industry by a high water-table, the regions east of Brussels contain considerable, if difficult-to-access bauxite deposits. Difficult, until now anyways."
 BEL_Cas_effort:0 "Composante Air"
 BEL_Cas_effort_desc:0 "As we continue to build-up our forces, we must face the disquieting reality of industrial capacity. Even if every reasonable effort were made, we could not maintain command of our own skies against an industrial power the likes of France or a re-united Germany. Instead, efforts must be directed to ensuring that the brief windows of air superiority we can obtain are well used for ground support."
 BEL_blue_navy:0 "An Oceangoing Fleet"
 BEL_blue_navy_desc:0 "At the end of the last war, our navy was offically disbanded, the assumption being that our naval defense was secured by our erstwhile protectors and allies. Though we have begun to correct this grave error of judgement, we yet lack the naval capacity to protect our trade-routes and colonial holdings. If we are to make good this glaring deficiency in our defense, we must build a blue-water navy."
 BEL_mil_final:0 "A Nation at Arms"
 BEL_mil_final_desc:0 "Though the last war left us a nation battered, it also left undeniably unbeaten.

 BEL_wallonie_flanders_idea_unified_desc:0 "Though the gulf between the Waloons and Flemish remains, the tensions associated with them have begun to fade, and a true national identity is beginning to emerge."
 BEL_cas_discount_idea:0 "Airborne Artillery"
 BEL_cas_discount_idea_desc:0 "By abandoning pretenses of true air superiority and focusing chiefly on an effective strike force which can operate in air-parity, we have considerably decreased production costs."
 BEL_armed_and_ready:0 "On Les Aura!"
 BEL_armed_and_ready_desc:0 "With a reinvigorated general staff, with a populace rallied and confident, with a military reequipped and rapidly modernising, we once-more are ready to prove, come what may, the defiant words of our late Soldier-King, Albert I. 'Belgium is a country, not a road.'"

 BEL_union_idea:0 "연합의 힘"
 BEL_union_idea_desc:0 "The Benelux Union, a formal repudiation of the Treaty of London, has created a United Confederation of the Low Countries. Unfortunately, that democratic, confederate model requires considerable political capital to maintain, and slows our ability to take unilateral action by seeking internal unity."

 BEL_terror_idea:0 "벨기에 공포"
 BEL_armed_neutrality_idea:0 "무장한 중립국"

 BEL_congo_for_calais_desc:0 "Whilst Westhoek was traditionally a part of the low countries, stripped from us at the end of the Napoleanic wars, it now sits, uneasily, inside French borders. The French may, given their weakening global position, agree to swap it for both our good will, and our considerable colonial holdings in the Congo north of Leopoldville."
 BEL_swap:0 "We will propose a swap of our African Holdings north of Stanleyville for Pas de Calais."
