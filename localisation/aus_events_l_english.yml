  austria.1036.t:0 "Instability in Slovenia"
  austria.1036.d:0 "It seems like not every one in Austria is happy about the recent changes. But it seems like the ethnic Slovene Population is especially unhappy about our new government. After the Great War Slovenia was about to be partitioned between Italy, Croatia and Austria. To avoid the fate of Italianization and partition, the Slovene Population asked Austria, Russia and the Entente to stay under Austrian rule. While never fully liking Austrian rule, Slovenia still greatly prospered during the latter decades and never suffered huge discrimination. To avoid more conflict between Austria, Croatia and Italy the allied powers compromised. Austria would be able to keep Slovenia, with provinces being able to vote on autonomy. In the end the province of Ljubljana gained autonomy while Lower Styria, with its bigger german population, was fully integrated into Austria. Dollfuss has no abolished the autonomy rights for Ljubljana and now many Slovenes fear Austrianization.

  austria.1039.d:0 "The partisan clearing has been a failure. The units were not able to find the resistance cells and their leaders and suffered heavy casulties due to guerilla warfare. Furthermore the unethnical handling with the civilian population have only increased the support of the partisan groups and caused more attacks on the infrastructure.

We have burned down forests, shelled villages with mortars and took civilians as hostages. After the ruthless guerilla warfare of the Slovenes Bastards this was the only possible way. Slovene resistance is now broken and can not except support from other nations."
